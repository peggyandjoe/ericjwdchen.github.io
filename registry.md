## How the Sausage is Made

This site is built on [Jekyll][jekyll], forked originally from [Poole][poole], and generously hosted on [GitHub Pages][gp]. The repository for the website is [here][repo].

Math equations are created using [MathJax][mj]. Syntax highlighting is done with [highlight.js][h.js] using the Solarized Light theme.

The [logo][l] is an homage to the brown [Zune 30][Zune 30], Microsoft's deeply flawed yet iconic iPod competitor and my favorite electronic device. Mine was white, but brown makes for a better logo.
