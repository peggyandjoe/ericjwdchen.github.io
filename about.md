##How the Sausage is Made

This site is built on [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/), forked originally from [Poole](http://getpoole.com/), and generously hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).

The logo is an homage to the brown [Zune 30](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zune_30), Microsoft's deeply flawed yet iconic iPod competitor. Mine was white, but brown makes for a better logo.
