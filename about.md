Hey there! I'm Eric Chen.

I live in Wisconsin and attend the [Lawrenceville School](http://www.lawrenceville.org/index.aspx).

I love food[^1], [podcasts](/my-favorite-podcasts), and technology.

You can [follow me on Twitter](https://twitter.com/ericjwdchen).

My email is eric.jwd.chen~at~gmail.com.

#How the Sausage is Made

This site is built on [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/), originally forked from [Poole](http://getpoole.com/), and hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).

The logo is an homage to the brown [Zune 30](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zune_30), the worst, best, and first portable device I could call my own[^2].

[^1]: Pro tip: eat avocados with anything savory.

[^2]: Mine was white, but brown was the more iconic color.
