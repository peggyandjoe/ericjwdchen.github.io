Hey there! I'm Eric Chen.

I live in Wisconsin and attend [Princeton University][pu]. In my past, I attended [The Lawrenceville School][ls]. I'm a technology, podcast, and cooking enthusiast.

You can find me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/ericjwdchen), [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ericjwdchen),[^1] and [Github](https://github.com/ericjwdchen). A full feed of this site is also available through [RSS](http://ericjwdchen.org/rss.xml) and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/ericjwdchen_org). My email is eric~at~ericjwdchen.org.

## How the Sausage is Made

This site is built on [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/), forked originally from [Poole](http://getpoole.com/), and generously hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/). The repository for the website is [here](https://github.com/ericjwdchen/ericjwdchen.github.io).

Footnote popovers[^2] are implemented using [bigfoot][bf].

Math equations are created using [MathJax][mj].

The [logo][l] is an homage to the brown [Zune 30](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zune_30), Microsoft's deeply flawed yet iconic iPod competitor and my favorite electronic device. Mine was white, but brown makes for a better logo.
