Hey there! I'm Eric Chen.

I live in Wisconsin and attend the [Lawrenceville School](http://www.lawrenceville.org/index.aspx). I am a member of Princeton University's Class of 2019. I love food, podcasts, and technology.

You can find me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/ericjwdchen) and [Github](https://github.com/ericjwdchen). IA full feed of this site is also available through [RSS](http://ericjwdchen.org/rss.xml) and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/ericjwdchen_org). My email is eric~at~ericjwdchen.org.

##How the Sausage is Made

This site is built on [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/), forked originally from [Poole](http://getpoole.com/), and generously hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/). The repository for the website is [here](https://github.com/ericjwdchen/ericjwdchen.github.io).

The logo is an homage to the brown [Zune 30](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zune_30), Microsoft's deeply flawed yet iconic iPod competitor. Mine was white, but brown makes for a better logo.
