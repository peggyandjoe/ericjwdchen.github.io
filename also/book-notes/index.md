> It is plain that the president of a university cannot transmit to the students his own values directly. his duties are so extensive that to conduct classes on a large scale is a practical impossibility. He must therefore utilize intermediaries, men of similar convictions, to do the job. This academic freedom forbids. It is therefore an appalling yet indisputable fact that because of the restraints of "academic freedom," the president of Yale has far less influence on the student body than have scores of influential professors who are allowed—in fact encouraged—to teach just as they will , to traffic, within loose limits, in whatever values they choose.
It is curious that the Corporation spends so much time and effort in selecting a president.

## [On Boxing][On Boxing - Amazon]

#### "...for boxing is about failure far more than it is about success."

There are no shortage of reviews and responses to this timeless Joyce Carol Oates anthology of essays about, and on, boxing. And rightly so. For a longtime outsider to the world of combat sports who only started paying more attention recently, beginning with Mayweather vs. Pacquiao last year, *On Boxing* captures perfectly what is so electric and captivating about boxing.

I can tell you, though, that it's not a rigid historical account of the all of the great 20th century boxing moments. Instead, this book explains *why* boxing is so enthralling. Boxing is in many ways the most primitive of sports, but Oates does a masterful job of encapsulating those ancient feelings and actions with words. This book, while short, is not superficial. *On Boxing* places you decades deep inside the culture of boxing. It's like when you listen to your grandfather talk about his past or when someone like Elon Musk talks about technology, some people have a way of communicating the essence of something so well that you walk away with your mouth wide open because things make *sense* now. That is what Oates has done. A lifetime of experience in only 200 some odd pages. Not a bad deal.

To illustrate, Oates in her own words on boxing:

> Which returns us to the paradox of boxing: its obsessive appeal for many who find in it not only a spectacle involving sensational feats of physical skill but an emotional experience impossible to convey in words; an art form, as I've suggested, with no natural analogue in the arts. Of course it is primitive, too, as birth, death and erotic love might be said to be primitive, and forces our reluctant acknowledgement of that the most profound experiences of our lives are physical events—though we believe ourselves to be, and surely are, essentially spiritual beings.

## [Flash Boys: A Wall Street Revolt][the flash boys - Amazon]

#### "They traded in the market the way card counters in a casino played blackjack: They played only when they had an edge."

As the saying goes, don't bring a knife to a gunfight. If you're an individual investor on Wall Street, the lesson from Michael Lewis's *Flash Boys* is that you have the knife, and the high frequency traders have the guns. It's a fools game—no different than roulette at the casino. The house knows the odds, and they're not in your favor.

*Flash Boys*, if a little repetitive towards the end, was an enjoyable read written accessibly with solid characters and an easy to follow narrative.
