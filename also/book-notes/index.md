#### "Again, I maintain that most universities have espoused—and continue to do so—collectively, one value as opposed to another."

More than anything else, the highest praise that can be given for *A Random Walk Down Wall Street* is that it is a no-nonsense book. Burton Malkiel advocates that index-based investing ought to form the core of most every individual investor's portfolio. No more stock-picking, investment advisors, or hot gossip about which tech company will be the Facebook from your buddy at the golf course.

Here is one analogy that I always come back to when thinking about how ludicrous it is that more investors don't practice low-fee, index investing. There are millions of active traders in the stock market: traders for big Wall Street banks, mutual fund and hedge fund managers, and many day-traders at home. To think that by spending 5 hours a week reading Forbes and Yahoo Finance gives you enough information to beat the professionals is a little like thinking that you can play in the NBA by practicing 5 hours a week.

Stock trading is a zero-sum game. Every winner who buys an underpriced security needs a schlub on the other end selling an underpriced security. Every winner who sells an overpriced security needs a schlub on the other end buying an overpriced security. In fact, because of transaction fees, it is often the case that both traders are schlubs, and only the broker comes out ahead. So it's you against the professionals. You against LeBron James in a game of 1-on-1 to 10. You against Tiger Woods in 18-hole match play. Yes, you might get a lucky basket on LeBron, and you might chip in against Tiger to take a hole from him. But luck and skill should not be confused.

It's also refreshing to see that the current edition of the book, the 11th, is a legitimate 11th edition. Too often, textbook publishers create new editions simply by rearranging chapters, reordering exercises, and changing the typesetting of the book—all without one material change to the actual content. In this edition, Malkiel addresses recent challenges to the Efficient-Market Hypothesis, such as behavioral finance and "smart beta." What's more, he includes recent economic data up through 2014, when this edition was published.

> It is plain that the president of a university cannot transmit to the students his own values directly. his duties are so extensive that to conduct classes on a large scale is a practical impossibility. He must therefore utilize intermediaries, men of similar convictions, to do the job. This academic freedom forbids. It is therefore an appalling yet indisputable fact that because of the restraints of "academic freedom," the president of Yale has far less influence on the student body than have scores of influential professors who are allowed—in fact encouraged—to teach just as they will , to traffic, within loose limits, in whatever values they choose.

>It is curious that the Corporation spends so much time and effort in selecting a president.

## [On Boxing][On Boxing - Amazon]

#### "...for boxing is about failure far more than it is about success."

There are no shortage of reviews and responses to this timeless Joyce Carol Oates anthology of essays about, and on, boxing. And rightly so. For a longtime outsider to the world of combat sports who only started paying more attention recently, beginning with Mayweather vs. Pacquiao last year, *On Boxing* captures perfectly what is so electric and captivating about boxing.

I can tell you, though, that it's not a rigid historical account of the all of the great 20th century boxing moments. Instead, this book explains *why* boxing is so enthralling. Boxing is in many ways the most primitive of sports, but Oates does a masterful job of encapsulating those ancient feelings and actions with words. This book, while short, is not superficial. *On Boxing* places you decades deep inside the culture of boxing. It's like when you listen to your grandfather talk about his past or when someone like Elon Musk talks about technology, some people have a way of communicating the essence of something so well that you walk away with your mouth wide open because things make *sense* now. That is what Oates has done. A lifetime of experience in only 200 some odd pages. Not a bad deal.

To illustrate, Oates in her own words on boxing:

> Which returns us to the paradox of boxing: its obsessive appeal for many who find in it not only a spectacle involving sensational feats of physical skill but an emotional experience impossible to convey in words; an art form, as I've suggested, with no natural analogue in the arts. Of course it is primitive, too, as birth, death and erotic love might be said to be primitive, and forces our reluctant acknowledgement of that the most profound experiences of our lives are physical events—though we believe ourselves to be, and surely are, essentially spiritual beings.

## [Flash Boys: A Wall Street Revolt][the flash boys - Amazon]

#### "They traded in the market the way card counters in a casino played blackjack: They played only when they had an edge."

As the saying goes, don't bring a knife to a gunfight. If you're an individual investor on Wall Street, the lesson from Michael Lewis's *Flash Boys* is that you have the knife, and the high frequency traders have the guns. It's a fools game—no different than roulette at the casino. The house knows the odds, and they're not in your favor.

*Flash Boys*, if a little repetitive towards the end, was an enjoyable read written accessibly with solid characters and an easy to follow narrative.
