title: Mathematical Induction Divisibility by 7 Example
---

Prove that \\(3^{2n+1}+2^{n+2}\\) is divisible by 7 for every nonnegative integer n.

<hr>

Let \\(P(n)\\) be: \\(3^{2n+1}+2^{n+2}\\) is divisible by 7.

We wish to show that \\(P(n)\\) is true \\(\forall n \geq0\\).

We first verify the base \\(n=0\\) case:
\\[3^{2\times0+1}+2^{0+2}=3^1+2^2=7\\]
