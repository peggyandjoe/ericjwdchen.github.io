title: Taylor Swift's New Direction
---

I haven't been on the Taylor Swift bandwagon forever. When I first heard "Teardrops on My Guitar," I wrote her off as kitschy and "a fad."

But as things have their way of happening, no longer than two years after my initial sour reaction, my opinions changed. I saw past my first impressions and fell in love with her music.

Five years ago I couldn't have told you what made Taylor's music was so magnetic. It just was.

Now, though, I know what that "X-Factor" was.[^1]

Here are two examples:

<style>.embed-container { position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; height: auto; } .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container embed { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; }</style><div class='embed-container'><iframe src='http://www.youtube.com/embed/QSMOcaZlMUI?start=46&amp;end=70' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen></iframe></div>

I was attracted to these anecdotes.

>The playful conversation starts

>Counter all your quick remarks

>Like passing notes in secrecy

woven into honest, mellifluous tunes.
