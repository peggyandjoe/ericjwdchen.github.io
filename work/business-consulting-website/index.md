## [Business Consulting Website][JEAP] (2016)

This is a site that I am building for a one-person consulting shop. The site hasn't yet gone live, but the design is mostly finished.

Instead of spreading out the information over many pages, I designed a one-page site that communicates a focused set of services and encourages visitors to scroll through all of the site.

I chose white hero text on a black background. It's a simple look that is striking and does well to pitch the consulting services. Compared to other 2000s era business sites,[^1] I believe that this design stands apart while still maintaining a professional and elegant appearance. After all, if you're pitching consulting services, it pays to show potential clients that you take care in having a well-polished and modern website.

The rest of the site uses a material design inspired card aesthetic. Each heading is placed in its own card. And each card has a bold splash of color at the top.

While the site is only one-page, there are links in the header which automatically scroll the user to the particular card. This lets users access specific cards quickly and also gives them a sense of space within the site.

There is only dummy information right now (generated from [Bacon Ipsum][bacon ipsum]). But the design is flexible to support more information in each card as well as more cards.
