A collection of projects I've worked on recently.

##The Lawrence (2014-2015)

This is a project that I worked on for my school newspaper. I built a brand-new WordPress theme to meet the specific demands of our newspaper.

There's been a big push by Facebook, Twitter, and Google to create proprietary platforms that make the open web better, faster, and simpler on mobile. Essentially, to make it suck less.

Instead of relying on proprietary solutions to make things suck less, why not just make the web suck less?

Of course, big publishers have inertia preventing them from making the web better, but when I was building this site, I had none of those roadblocks.

I knew that from the user's perspective, nothing mattered more than just reading an article. News is an ephemeral thing. People don't read news on the publisher's terms. The read it on their terms—whenever they want and however they want.

Understanding these facts, my primary focus was responsive design. Our old site was a cookie-cutter WordPress template—and it looked like it, too. The previous theme was a fixed-width layout. Serviceable for 2005, but not for 2015. I eventually settled on a simple two-column design that collapsed down to one-column on mobile.

I started the project from scratch with no knowledge of HTML, CSS, or Javascript. As a one-person development and design team, the one thing I did know was that the scope of the project had to be conservative.

Looking back on the project, I strongly believe that these constraints were to the benefit of the end result. I wasn't chasing after the latest fad in design. I targeted a barebones design that had a singular focus of delivering the newspaper's content as efficiently as possible. As a result, the reading experience is phenomenal. No sidebars. No popovers. Nothing at all except the words and images that were meant to be there.

I also wanted the site to be easy to navigate. I ended up dividing the navigation to primary and secondary. The primary navigation is what you would expect to see flipping through a physical newspaper: News, Editorial, Sports, etc. I placed this navigation in bold directly under the logo.

I decided to place less-used navigation in a secondary group, primarily featuring links that are 'bonus' to the physical newspaper: About, Masthead, Contact, etc.

###Article Page

My goal for the article page was to put 100% of the focus on the article itself.
To achieve this goal, I used the size and color of the text to communicate importance and purpose. For example, the biggest thing you see on the page is the headline. This sounds simple enough, but there are sites where the headline is not clearly the focus of the page.

I chose to show which category the article was in with a smaller green text. And I have the byline and publishing date in small text right under the headline.

Put all together, I was able to communicate a consistent structure to the user without heavy use of icons and other more attention-demanding visual indicators. By keeping the level of noise low, I was able to let the signal—the article itself—come through.
