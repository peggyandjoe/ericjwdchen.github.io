A collection of projects I've worked on recently.

## [Business Consulting Website][JEAP] (2016)
*Focused and professional.*

This is a site that I am building for a one-person consulting shop. The site hasn't yet gone live, but the design is mostly finished.

Instead of spreading out the information over many pages, I designed a one-page site that communicates a focused set of services and encourages visitors to scroll through all of the site.

I chose white hero text on a black background. It's a simple look that is striking and does well to pitch the consulting services. Compared to other 2000s era business sites,[^1] I believe that this design stands apart while still maintaining a professional and elegant appearance. After all, if you're pitching consulting services, it pays to show potential clients that you take care in having a well-polished and modern website.

The rest of the site uses a material design inspired card aesthetic. Each heading is placed in its own card. And each card has a bold splash of color at the top.

While the site is only one-page, there are links in the header which automatically scroll the user to the particular card. This lets users access specific cards quickly and also gives them a sense of space within the site.

There is only dummy information right now (generated from [Bacon Ipsum][bacon ipsum]). But the design is flexible to support more information in each card as well as more cards.

## [Newspaper Redesign for *The Lawrence*][the lawrence] (2014-2015)
*Bringing the print to the web.*

This is a project that I worked on for my school newspaper. I built a brand-new WordPress theme to meet the specific demands of our newspaper.

There's been a big push by [Facebook][instant articles], [Twitter][10k words], and [Google][amp] to create proprietary platforms that make the open web better, faster, and simpler on mobile. Essentially, to make it [suck less][idle words talk].

Instead of relying on proprietary solutions to make things suck less, why not just make the web suck less?

Of course, big publishers have inertia preventing them from making the web better, but when I was building this site, I had none of those roadblocks.

I knew that from the user's perspective, nothing mattered more than just reading an article. News is an ephemeral thing. People don't read news on the publisher's terms. They read it on their own terms—whenever they want and however they want.

Understanding these facts, my primary focus was responsive design. Our [old site][old site screenshot] was a cookie-cutter WordPress template—and it looked like it, too. The previous theme was a fixed-width layout. Serviceable for 2005, but not for 2015. I eventually settled on a simple two-column design that collapsed down to one-column on mobile.

I started the project from scratch with no knowledge of HTML, CSS, or Javascript. As a one-person development and design team, the one thing I did know was that the scope of the project had to be conservative.

Looking back on the project, I strongly believe that these constraints were to the benefit of the end result. I wasn't chasing after the latest fad in design. I targeted a barebones design that had a singular focus of delivering the newspaper's content as efficiently as possible. As a result, the reading experience is phenomenal. No sidebars. No popovers. Nothing at all except the words and images that were meant to be there.

I also wanted the site to be easy to navigate. I ended up dividing the navigation to primary and secondary. The primary navigation is what you would expect to see flipping through a physical newspaper: News, Editorial, Sports, etc. I placed this navigation in bold directly under the logo.

I decided to place less-used navigation in a secondary group, primarily featuring links that are 'bonus' to the physical newspaper: About, Masthead, Contact, etc.

### Article Page

![The Lawrence Desktop Article](/assets/2015/01/the-lawrence-desktop-article.png)*The article page on a desktop*

My goal for the article page was to put 100% of the focus on the article itself.
To achieve this goal, I used the size and color of the text to communicate importance and purpose. For example, the biggest thing you see on the page is the headline. This sounds simple enough, but there are sites where the headline is not clearly the focus of the page.

I chose to show which category the article was in with a smaller green text. And I have the byline and publishing date in small text right under the headline.

Put all together, I was able to communicate a consistent structure to the user without heavy use of icons and other more attention-demanding visual indicators. By keeping the level of noise low, I was able to let the signal—the article itself—come through.
